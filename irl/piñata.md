# Playing Surf Darts In Real Life
This guide explains how to play a physical version of Surf Darts using simple materials, with a fun twist inspired by pi√±atas to simulate a moving target!

## Materials Needed
- A large sheet of sturdy paper or poster board to serve as the dartboard.
- A rope or sturdy string.
- A hole punch.
- A place to hang the board (like a doorway, a ceiling hook, or a tree branch).
- A compass for drawing circles accurately.
- A ruler for measuring distances (in cm or inches).
- A fine-tipped marker or pen to act as your "dart".
- Paper and a pen for scoring.

## Setup
Draw the Board: Use your compass to draw a large "Original Circle" (we'll call it Circle O) on your poster board. A radius of 25 cm (~10 inches) is a good start.

Mark the Center: Clearly mark the exact center point of Circle O.

Hang the Board: Punch a hole near the top edge of the poster board, thread the string through it, and hang the board so it can swing freely at a comfortable height.

## Gameplay
This version is best played with at least two people: a "Player" who throws the dart and a "Mover" who controls the board. The game is played over a maximum of five rounds and ends immediately if the Player misses the target circle.

Round 1: Aim for the Swinging Circle O

The Mover stands to the side and gently pushes the hanging board to make it swing.

The Player stands a short distance away and throws the marker (the "dart") at the moving board, aiming for anywhere inside Circle O.

If the dart lands outside Circle O, the game is over.

If it hits, mark the landing spot as Point A. This will be the center of your next circle.

Use your ruler to measure the distance from Point A to the center of Circle O. This distance is the radius for your next target, Circle A.

Using your compass, draw Circle A centered on Point A with the radius you just measured.

Round 2: Aim for Circle A

The Mover once again gets the board swinging.

The Player throws the dart, this time aiming for the inside of the new Circle A on the moving board.

If you miss Circle A, the game ends.

If you hit, mark this new landing spot as Point B.

Measure the distance from Point B to the center of Circle A (which is Point A). This distance is the radius for Circle B.

Draw Circle B centered on Point B with this new radius.

Rounds 3, 4, & 5

Continue in the same fashion, always aiming for the newest, smallest circle you just drew on the swinging board.

A successful hit in Round 3 creates Circle C, a hit in Round 4 creates Circle D, and a final hit in Round 5 creates Circle E.

## Scoring
Scoring rewards precision. A throw closer to the center of a target creates a new circle with a smaller radius, which earns more points.

Your score for each round is calculated as: (Radius of the Target Circle) - (Radius of the New Circle you created).

Your final score is the sum of the scores from all completed rounds.

### Scoring Example
Setup: You draw Circle O with a radius of 25 cm.

Round 1:

You hit the swinging Circle O at Point A.

You measure the distance from Point A to the center of Circle O, which is 10 cm. This becomes the radius of Circle A.

Round 1 Score: 25 cm (Radius of O) - 10 cm (Radius of A) = 15 points.

Round 2:

You hit the swinging Circle A (which has a 10 cm radius) at Point B.

You measure the distance from Point B to the center of Circle A. It is 4 cm. This is the radius of Circle B.

Round 2 Score: 10 cm (Radius of A) - 4 cm (Radius of B) = 6 points.

Total Score After Two Rounds: 15 + 6 = 21 points.
